# Dimitriâ€™s Cloud Infrastructure

## Overview
This infrastructure hosts the AI Assistant at [www.talk-to-my-ai.click](https://www.talk-to-my-ai.click). It is fully provisioned by Terraform in AWS.

## Core Components
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**  
  - Runs EC2 instances hosting the AI Assistant container.
  - Scales automatically based on load.

- **Launch Template**  
  - Defines the AMI, user data, and security groups for EC2.

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**  
  - Terminates HTTPS and forwards traffic on port 80 to EC2 instances.
  - Provides a single entry point for the AI Assistant.

- **Route 53 DNS**  
  - The domain `talk-to-my-ai.click` points to the ALB.

- **ACM Certificates**  
  - AWS Certificate Manager handles SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.

- **Security Groups**  
  - Allow HTTP/80 from all.
  - Allow SSH/22 only from VPC CIDR.

- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**  
  - Stores Docker images built from the `container/` folder.

## Workflow
1. Code changes push to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions run Terraform (in `terraform/`) and update infrastructure.
3. CI/CD builds the Docker image from `container/` and pushes to ECR.
4. Auto Scaling Group pulls the new image and redeploys automatically.

## Why This Design
- **Scalability:** Auto Scaling Group grows/shrinks based on demand.
- **Security:** ACM provides TLS; Security Groups limit SSH.
- **Automation:** Terraform + GitHub Actions handle provisioning and deployment.
- **Visibility:** Diagram automatically generated by `terraform graph`.
